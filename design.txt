# GENERAL USAGE NOTES

- For the process of random generation of board, I decided to define a recursive function.
The function as I designed it work pretty much the same way than the flood fill algorithm
with the difference that the flood fill stops when the condition are reached (straight size of the boat essentially).
It does the job for a little amount of boat of short size (less than 25 box).
Given that the first player should be reasonnable during the setting step.
Indeed, I decided to not prevent the creation of a large amount of big boat,
assuming it could eventually raise an Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded'. So please be carefull.

- In a future reflexion I'd like to implement a push queue in order to always have a set of board instantly available
to shorten the setting step. The board won't be generated anymore but just got in the datastore.

- If you decide to execute createTwoplayersGame endpoints without insert any board size or board setup, default values will be token.
